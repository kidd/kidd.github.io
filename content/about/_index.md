This is me

I'm Raimon Grau, a software developer born in Barcelona and currently
living in Tenerife. I love reading, programming, and good
conversations.

I'm working as a software developer at
[Kong](https://konghq.com). Btw, we're hiring. If you happen to like
and know Lua, OpenResty, HTTP, shell, docker,... shoot me an
[email](mailto:raimonster@gmail.com) and we might have a talk.

I've programmed professionally in Common Lisp in this current century,
and that's something not many people can say. I'm very happy and
proud about that.

I try to find solutions to problems in a minimalistic and suckless
way. I've done Bash, Common Lisp, Lua, Perl, Ruby for a living. But I'm
interested in maaany other languages.
