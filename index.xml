      <description>When installing a package with nix-shell, you get a temporary profile that contains everything that was on your parent profile (where you ran nix-shell) plus the installed packages from that nix-shell command.
nixpkgs repo is big and generally ok, but there are hurdles here and there, that you must be able to jump if you want to walk least-walked-paths.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see what happens (from my dimm understanding still) when you install a dynamic library that is not directly linked from your installed packages.</description>

      <description>Parts:  arduino uno Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04) 2 leds buzzer? lcd screen a fridge MAGNETS! (of course, the secret sauce)  
Story Small hacky project where by installing an arduino with some very basic sensors, you can detect when the fridge&amp;rsquo;s door is left open.
Maybe you can relate, maybe not, but the fridge at my new place has some issues when closing the door, and sometimes it doesn&amp;rsquo;t close properly (you have to make sure every time it&amp;rsquo;s been properly closed, and not 99% closed)</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to get into Lisp again and last week it came to my hands a problem that looked like a perfect case for giving CL another try.
The problem is about a very special sudoku with only 4 initial values. The sudoku has, of course special rules:
 The square in the middle is a magic square (all rows,columns, and digonals add up the same). Both diagonals of the board can&amp;rsquo;t have repeated numbers.</description>

      <description>Experienced Common Lisp professionally for the first time. An experience difficult to forget.
Working in an AI (nlp) platform extracting structured info from unstructured text.
Appart from working on the maintenance of one of the main tools, I started from scratch a real time api with a pubub model where subscribers connect to an endpoint adding a custom filter in the querystring, and automatically creating (or assigning if already existed) a channel with live news matching the filters.</description>
