# Raimon Grau

This is me

## Who am I:

I'm Raimon Grau, a software developer born in Barcelona and living
in Tenerife. I love reading, programming, and good conversations.

I'm working as a software developer at
[Kong](https://konghq.com). Btw, we're hiring. If you happen to like
and know Lua, OpenResty, HTTP, shell, docker,... shoot me an
[email](mailto:raimonster@gmail.com) and we might have a talk.

I've programmed professionally on Common Lisp in this current century,
and that's something not many people can say. And very happy and
proud about that.

I'm currently working as a freelance software engineer helping
companies grow using tech that's often not so mainstream.
